BlackCat_Libraries is an ongoing project created by Joseph Jaspers 
Focuses include highly optimized linear-algebra routines and Neural Networks with both GPU and CPU support. 

All libraries are header only (aside from .cu files) and have been designed with the intention of supporting compilation via NVCC (Nvidia CUDA Compiler) and the newest GCC and g++. 

For more details on each library, go to their directroy to find their respective README's.
